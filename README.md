# Spam-Filteration

This project aims to develop a robust spam filter using machine learning techniques to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. By analyzing message content, the filter effectively classifies incoming emails or texts, enhancing email security and improving user experience. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, leveraging a highly imbalanced dataset to achieve accurate and efficient spam detection.
